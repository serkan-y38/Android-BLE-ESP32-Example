#### Bluetooth Low Energy:
#### Receive data from an ESP32 BLE server
#### Send data to an ESP32 BLE server from an Android device
#### Connect to a BLE server as a client

##### When the client connects, the BLE server generates a random number, and the Android app collects the generated random numbers. Additionally, the Android app sends text data to the BLE server.
